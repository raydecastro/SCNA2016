# Software Craftsmanship North America (SCNA) 2016 
* Day of Code
* Code Retreat

## Code Retreat Rules
* Each session is 45 minutes long
* Each pair switches with new members on every session change
* Code must be deleted on every session change
* Use Test Driven Development

## Four rules of simple design
* Tests pass
* Expresses intent
* No duplication
* Short

## Conway's Game of Life Rules
* 1. Any live cell with < 2 live neighbors dies of under population
* 2. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors lives on
* 3. Any live cell with > 3 live neighbors dies of over population
* 4. Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors comes alive

## Constraints 

### Step 1
* No constraints

### Step 2
* No primitives across method boundaries 
* Input and output must be defined by us

### Step 3
* Silent TDD
* No talking, no chatting

### Step 4
* Code like it's 1969
* you can only run the tests and code twice for the whole session.
